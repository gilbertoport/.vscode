The placeholder nice, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”, 
looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar 
from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler nice.
In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin
word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et 
Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. nice from the Roman philosopher Cicero.
